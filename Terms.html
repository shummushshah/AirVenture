<b>Air Venture Terms & Conditions</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>1. Introduction</b><br>
1.1 These are our general terms of business that apply to all projects. An agreement will be made prior to starting work on a new project.
<br><br>
<b>2. General terms</b><br>
2.1 A pre-visit is advised to make sure we get the best image capture possible from your image. During this time, we'll also check to see if your venue will work with a 3D virtual tour. Based on your location and what we observe during our initial visit, we always provide the best advice. In the event that a pre-visit is not feasible, you might be asked to submit some photos.<br>
<br>
<b>3. Pricing & Quotation</b>
<br>
3.1 The cost of our services depends on a variety of variables, including the length of time it takes to complete a tour capture, the amount of after-work time needed, processing time, travel time, expenses, and the venue's complexity.
<br>
3.2 Quotes are valid for 28 days.
<br>
3.3 We reserve the right to change our prices at any time and without prior notice.
<br>
<br>
<b>4. Deposit</b>
<br>
4.1 Before your tour capture day, a 25% deposit of the quoted price is due. We reserve the right to cancel or reschedule the tour capture day if the deposit is not paid.
<br>
<br>
<b>5. Cancellations</b>
<br>
5.1 Cancellations must be made in writing/emailed.
<br>
5.2 A fee equal to 50% of the deposit will be charged for cancellations made less than seven working days before the scheduled image capture date.
<br>
5.3 A fee equal to the full deposit amount will be charged for cancellations made on the day of the scheduled image capture date.
A new quote may be given in the event of a cancellation. This will be handled like a brand-new project.
<br>
<br>
<b>6. Tour capture day</b>
<br>
6.1 The space is recorded using our equipment "as is." This means that the lighting and contents of the room will be exactly as it is on the day. The client is in charge of making sure the area is ready for photoshoots. Please make sure to remove anything private or valuable before our arrival if you don't want it to be seen during the tour. Once we have completed our scans, the only way to remove anything from a tour is to conduct a full re-shoot, which is fee-based.
<br>
6.2 No locations will be "dressed" by our photographer; instead, the rooms will be captured as they are on the day. A fee will be applied to any photography that needs to be reshot because of poor planning.
<br>
6.3 The client will be charged an additional £100 per hour on the final invoice if delays occur as a result of inadequate venue preparation on their end. 
<br>
6.4 Direct sunlight can affect the infrared sensors on our camera equipment. In order to get the best lighting and scan accuracy, we might ask for the blinds or doors to be closed.
<br>
6.5 Our camera equipment is best suited to creating a 3D map of indoor spaces. Outdoor areas can be captured however this can only be accomplished where there is no direct sunlight. Typically outdoor spaces are instead captured as high resolution 360 degree photography and integrated into your tour.
<br>
6.6 When your virtual tour is displayed in "dollhouse" or "plan view," any spaces, such as voids or small gaps/cupboards, that cannot be accessed or photographed may appear as blank spaces.
<br>
6.7 AirVenture is not responsible or liable for any costs incurred as a result of a business closing down or a property being shut down while image capture is taking place. The day of your image capture will, however, need to work for both parties, so we will be accommodating.
<br>
<br>

<b>7. Post-Production</b>
<br>
7.1 Our goal is to complete your post-production work as quickly as possible and deliver the finished tour to you within 5 working days, but this goal may change during busy times. At the time of booking, we will always provide a turn-around time estimate.
AirVenture cannot be held accountable or liable for any expenses incurred as a result of a delay in the production of any of our services because of the nature of the work and the impossibility of establishing precise deadlines.
<br>
<br>

<b>8. Software</b>
<br>
8.1 The Matterport online player and any third-party software used in conjunction with your project may change, receive software updates, or have functionality added or removed without notice from AirVenture.
<br>
8.2 The Matterport virtual tour viewer is compatible with the majority of recent mobile and web browsers; however, we disclaim all responsibility for compatibility issues with specific devices or outdated web browsers.
<br>
8.3 The Matterport terms of service apply to the tour, which is hosted on the Matterport cloud. In addition to not being held liable for Matterport cloud outages or errors, AirVenture also won't be held responsible for any financial or commercial losses brought on by problems with third-party software.
<br>
8.4 Virtual tours are not covered by a warranty from AirVenture; any errors or problems must be mentioned prior to or at the time of project sign-off.
<br>
8.5 Once a project is published and made live, AirVenture is not duty-bound to store copies of original image capture data.
<br>
8.6 AirVenture is only able to offer Matterport virtual tours for as long as their company or product is still in operation. We have no control over modifications made to their business model.
<br>
<br>

<b>9. Health & Safety</b>
<br>
9.1 The client and site owner are responsible for adhering to health and safety regulations. Our photographer has the right to halt all work if they believe their safety may be in jeopardy. Unless otherwise specified, this delay will incur a charge of £50 per hour and be reflected on the final invoice.
<br>
9.2 If our equipment is in danger of being harmed by environmental conditions present on the job site, such as building work, dust, heat, steam, or water, we reserve the right to reschedule the project until the issue has been resolved. 
<br>
<br>

<b>10. The client’s responsibilities</b>
<br>
10.1 The client consents to pay AirVenture in full and provide the data necessary to complete the work as quickly as possible. The client also agrees to make sure the location is ready for the tour capture and that our staff can work in a secure environment.
<br>
<br>

<b>11. The responsibilities of AirVenture</b>
<br>
11.1 Throughout the project, we'll offer frank, knowledgeable counsel. After performing the tour capture at the client's location, we will send the client links to the 3D virtual tour that is stored on the Matterport cloud.
<br>
<br>

<b>12. Ownership</b>
<br>
The virtual tour belongs to the client if all payments are current and a hosting subscription is in effect.
12.2 Despite the fact that the client owns the overall virtual tour, AirVenture retains the right to showcase finished public-facing work on our website portfolio and social media channels. Anything deemed sensitive or business-sensitive is exempt from this.
<br>
<br>

<b>13. Optional extras</b>
<br>
13.1 Depending on the size and configuration of your venue, the cost of annotated tags, embedded videos, images, or the provision of 2D schematic floor plans may change.
<br>
13.2 It's totally acceptable if you need extras in the middle of a project. With your consent, the price of these will be added to your invoice.
<br>
13.3 Matterport schematic floor plans are roughly 99.9% accurate, but we advise using them for general sales and marketing purposes. You should speak with an architect to create plans as accurately as possible.
<br>
13.4 Schematic floor plans are provided in PDF or PNG formats only.
<br>
13.5 We can extract a number of excellent stills from your virtual tour, but for the best results, a professional stills photographer is recommended. Different lenses and flash lighting are needed for different shaped rooms.
<br>
<br>

<b>14. Virtual tour hosting</b>
<br>
14.1 The tour is hosted on the Matterport cloud and is subject to a hosting charge. A minimum of one month’s hosting is included within the price quoted to capture your tour, though we may run promotions to include more free months. To keep the tour live after this period, hosting charges apply.
<br>
14.2 AirVenture agrees to process and host the produced Matterport Space(s) for a period of one month following the date of capture on the Matterport platform. After the first month, hosting will cost £20 per month; if paid yearly, there is a 20% discount.
<br>
14.3 Prior to the required period starting, payment for the required period must be made to AirVenture. The tour will stop being hosted at the end of the paid-for period if no money is received.
Without limiting any other remedies, AirVenture will have the right to stop providing the 3D Services to the Customer in the event that they fail to pay any amounts when due. This will happen until the overdue amount is paid.
<br>
14.4 We hold the right to change our prices at any time and without notice.
<br>
14.5 The Customer is aware that AirVenture has no control over the hosting on Matterport servers. 
<br>
<br>

<b>15. Terms of payment</b>
<br>
15.1 AirVenture has the right to charge a late payment fee of 5% per month on any overdue and unpaid balance, to cover admin costs or interest. Additionally, AirVenture retains the right to postpone work until a late payment is made.
<br>
15.2 You can pay us with a credit card, cash, or a bank transfer. Cheques cannot be used to pay at our business.
<br>
15.3 After the tour is captured and processed, the client must pay the outstanding balance on the invoice before the virtual tour goes live and the client is given links.
<br>
15.4 If the client asks us to complete tasks outside of the country or abroad, we will include reasonable and fair travel costs in our quote before beginning any work.
<br>
15.5 You agree to pay us back if we have to pay legal fees, collection costs, or other expenses in an effort to recover unpaid invoices.
<br>
<br>

<b>16. Sign-Off</b>
<br>
16.1 The client will guarantee that their side of the project is being led by a single individual who has the authority to approve content.
<br>
16.2 The client agrees to provide AirVenture with text, images, and other materials for their project once they have been approved by the person with overall responsibility for the project in order to avoid wasting time or money.
<br>
16.3 The client will have up to 7 days to return any changes to extra content such as tags. If we don’t receive feedback in this time the project will be considered complete, made live and sent to the client.
<br>
16.4 The client understands that once a project is signed off it will be published. At this point the project is considered complete and no further changes will be possible.
<br>
16.5 You are in charge of ensuring that the information you give us verbally or in writing in connection with the performance of this agreement regarding your products and services is accurate, complete, and appropriate.

<br>
<br>
<b>17. Confidentiality</b>
<br>
17.1 AirVenture acknowledges that it must take all necessary precautions to protect the privacy of any confidential information or data that it develops for the client or that the client discloses to AirVenture, both during and after the term of its appointment. Additionally, if the client requests it, we can sign a non-disclosure agreement.
<br>
<br>

<b>18. Absence</b>
<br>
18.1 If an unexpected staff absence, such as an illness, occurs, we will work with you to find a new date to record the tour.
<br>
<br>

<b>19. Term and Termination</b>
<br>
19.1 This agreement will go into effect on the signing date and remain in effect until the project is launched or terminated by one of the parties.
<br>
19.2 If either party to this agreement defaults in the performance of any of its significant duties and obligations and the default is not cured within thirty (30) days of receiving notice of the default or if the default is not reasonably curable within said period of time, either party may terminate the agreement, unless the defaulting party begins to cure the default within said period of time and diligently pursues the default's cure.
Additionally, if either party becomes insolvent or has a petition filed against it under the insolvency laws of any jurisdiction, if the other party makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, if a trustee or similar agent is appointed with respect to any property or business of the other party, or in the case of the Client, if the Client materially violates its obligations under this agreement, either party may immediately terminate this agreement by giving the other party written notice.
<br>
19.3 The client is responsible for paying for any non-refundable materials or services we have committed to purchasing for your account (either specifically or as part of a plan, such as web software, photography, and/or outside services) in accordance with the terms of this agreement. We agree to use our best efforts to minimise such liabilities.
Up until the point the contract is terminated, the Client agrees to pay AirVenture Ltd in full for any unpaid staff time we have devoted to your project.
<br>
19.4 This agreement will be completely severable if any clause is found to be against the law, invalid, or unenforceable under any existing or future legislation. The remaining terms of this agreement will still be fully enforceable and construed as if the illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision had never been a part of it.
The laws of the United Kingdom shall apply in interpreting and governing this agreement.
